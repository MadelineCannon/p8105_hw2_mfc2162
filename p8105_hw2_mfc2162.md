## Problem 1

### Read and clean Mr. Trash Wheel set

``` r
mr_trash_wheel =
  read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", sheet = 1,
             range = "A2:N406") %>%
              janitor::clean_names() %>%
              drop_na(dumpster) %>%
              mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls, digits = 0)))
```

### Read and clean precipitation data

``` r
precip_2017 = read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx",
                         sheet = 4, range="A2:B14") %>%
                          janitor::clean_names() %>%
                          mutate(year = 2017) %>%
                          select(month, year, total)

precip_2018 = read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx",
                         sheet = 3, range="A2:B9") %>%
                          janitor::clean_names() %>%
                          mutate(year = 2018) %>%
                          select(month, year, total)
```

### Combine precipitation datasets and convert month to character variable

``` r
precip = bind_rows(precip_2017, precip_2018) %>%
                    mutate(month = month.name[month])
```

There are 285 observations in the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset, each
corresponding to a particular dumpster. There are 14 variables,
including the date, the weight and volume of the trash, the frequency of
each type of trash (e.g. number of cigarette butts, glass bottles,
grocery bags, etc), and the number of homes powered. The median number
of sports balls in a dumpter in 2017 was 8.

There are 19 observations in the precipitation dataset, each
corresponding to a particular month. There are three variables: month,
year, and total precipitation. The total precipitation in 2018 was 23.5.

## Problem 2

### Read and clean pols

``` r
pols = read_csv("./data/pols-month.csv") %>%
                separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day")) %>%
                mutate(month = month.name[as.integer(month)]) %>%
                mutate(president = "gop") %>%
                select(-day)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   mon = col_date(format = ""),
    ##   prez_gop = col_double(),
    ##   gov_gop = col_double(),
    ##   sen_gop = col_double(),
    ##   rep_gop = col_double(),
    ##   prez_dem = col_double(),
    ##   gov_dem = col_double(),
    ##   sen_dem = col_double(),
    ##   rep_dem = col_double()
    ## )

``` r
# Change president to "dem" if prez_dem = 1
for (row in 1:nrow(pols)) {
  if (pols[row, "prez_dem"] == 1) {
    pols[row, "president"] = "dem"
  }
}

# Remove prez_gop and prez_dem
pols = select(pols, -prez_gop, -prez_dem)
```

### Read and clean snp

``` r
snp = read_csv("./data/snp.csv") %>%
                separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year")) %>%
                mutate(month = month.name[as.integer(month)]) %>%
                select(year, month, close)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   date = col_character(),
    ##   close = col_double()
    ## )

### Read and clean unemployment

``` r
unemployment = read_csv("./data/unemployment.csv") %>%
                        pivot_longer(Jan:Dec,
                                     names_to = "month",
                                     values_to = "unemployment") %>%
                        mutate(month = match(month, month.abb)) %>%
                        mutate(month = month.name[month]) %>%
                        janitor::clean_names() %>%
                        mutate(year = as.character(year))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   Year = col_double(),
    ##   Jan = col_double(),
    ##   Feb = col_double(),
    ##   Mar = col_double(),
    ##   Apr = col_double(),
    ##   May = col_double(),
    ##   Jun = col_double(),
    ##   Jul = col_double(),
    ##   Aug = col_double(),
    ##   Sep = col_double(),
    ##   Oct = col_double(),
    ##   Nov = col_double(),
    ##   Dec = col_double()
    ## )

### Join the datasets

``` r
fivethirtyeight_data = left_join(pols, snp, by = c("year", "month"))

fivethirtyeight_data =
  left_join(fivethirtyeight_data, unemployment, by = c("year", "month"))
```

‘pols’ has 822 observations, each corresponding to a particular date
between 1947 and 2015. There are 9 variables that describe whether the
president at the time was a Republican or a Democrat and how many
Republican and Democratic senators, representatives, and governors there
were. ‘snp’ has 787 observations corresponding to dates between 1950 and
2015. There are 3 variables: year, month, and the S\&P stock market
index. ‘unemployment’ has 816 observations corresponding to dates
between 1948 and 2015. There are 3 variables: year, month, and the
unemployment rate. ‘fivethirtyeight\_data’ has 822 observations (dates
between 1947 and 2015) and 11 variables, and is the result of merging
the three datasets.

## Problem 3

### Read and clean baby names data

``` r
baby_names = read_csv("./data/Popular_Baby_Names.csv") %>%
                        janitor::clean_names() %>%
                        mutate(childs_first_name =
                                 str_to_title(childs_first_name))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   `Year of Birth` = col_double(),
    ##   Gender = col_character(),
    ##   Ethnicity = col_character(),
    ##   `Child's First Name` = col_character(),
    ##   Count = col_double(),
    ##   Rank = col_double()
    ## )

``` r
# Make names of ethnicities consistent
for (row in 1:nrow(baby_names)) {
  if (baby_names[row, "ethnicity"] == "ASIAN AND PACI") {
    baby_names[row, "ethnicity"] = "ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER"
  }
  if (baby_names[row, "ethnicity"] == "BLACK NON HISP") {
    baby_names[row, "ethnicity"] = "BLACK NON HISPANIC"
  }
  if (baby_names[row, "ethnicity"] == "WHITE NON HISP") {
    baby_names[row, "ethnicity"] = "WHITE NON HISPANIC"
  }
}

# Remove duplicates
baby_names = distinct(baby_names)
```

olivia_table = baby_names %>% filter(childs_first_name == "Olivia") %>%
                              select(-childs_first_name, -gender, -count) %>%
